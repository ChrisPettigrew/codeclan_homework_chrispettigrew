# Question 1.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(CodeClanData)
```

# Question 2. What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.

```{r}
head(backpack)
```


```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight))
```


#Question 3.Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?
```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "yellow"))
```


# Question 4-5. What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  aes(backpack_weight, body_weight, colour = sex) +
  geom_point()
```



# Question 6.What proportion of students report back pain?


```{r}
backpack %>%
  
```


Question 7.

Is this proportion different between men and women?

Question 8.

Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.

Try both backpack_weight and body_weight as well as the ratio.

Hint: faceting would be useful here.
