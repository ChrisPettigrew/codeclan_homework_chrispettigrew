# Dirty Data Project

## Dataset 2 : Cake Ingredients

Here is my report about my first dataset. 


### Cleaning notes


The datasets I used were `cake-ingredients-1961.csv` + `cake_ingredient_code.csv`. To clean it I did the following :


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
cakes <- read_csv("raw_data/cake-ingredients-1961.csv")
codes <- read_csv("raw_data/cake_ingredient_code.csv")
```

***

1. Ran a long pivot
2. Ran a left Join, whilst dropping the NA values
3. Ran the Janitor package to improve the variable names

***

### Here is my beautiful pipe:
```{r}
cakes <-
  cakes %>%
  pivot_longer(-Cake, names_to = "code", values_to = "amount") %>%
    left_join(codes) %>%
    drop_na(amount) %>%
    select(-code) %>%
    clean_names()
    
cakes

```

***

### Which cake has the most cocoa in it?
```{r}
cocoa_max <- cakes %>% filter(ingredient == "Cocoa") %>%
  arrange(desc(amount)) %>%
  head(1)
cocoa_max

```

***

### For sponge cake, how many cups of ingredients are used in total?
```{r}
sponge_cups <- cakes %>% filter(cake == "Sponge") %>%
                          filter(measure == "cup") %>%
                          summarise(sponge_cups = sum(amount))

```

***

### How many ingredients are measured in teaspoons?
```{r}
teaspoons <- cakes %>% filter(measure == "teaspoon") %>%
  distinct(ingredient)

teaspoons
```

***

### Which cake has the most unique ingredients?
```{r}

n_ingredients <- cakes %>%
  group_by(cake) %>%
  count(n_distinct(ingredient)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

n_ingredients
```
